# AI Face Recognition & Tracking
Face recognition for a Arduino Defense System, includes a hostile face tracking and more functionalities. Based on the haarscade model.  

# ðŸ’»Code 

The code detects and trains on faces using a locally stored binary pattern histogram called Haarscade model, made by a German professor. This model uses simple features to recognize patterns in grey-scale images (taken previously) to detect faces, and starts tracking them. It also detects hostile faces if they are not associated with a pre-made user, and starts pointing at them in an ominous way :O 

### Data Collect
The first code starts taking 500 pics to associate to a user. It detects the faces using the haarscade model after putting the pics in a grey-scale form.

### Training Demo
The second code trains on the previously taken images, more precisely:
